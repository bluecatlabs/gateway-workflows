# **Example Text Record Workflows**
## Add, Delete, and Update Text Records

**BlueCat Gateway Version:** 24.3.0 or greater <br/>
**BAM version:** 9.4.0 or greater <br/>
**Dependencies:** Configuration, View, and Zone previously created in Address Manager <br/>
**Description/Example Usage:** The Text Record includes name and text information, and associates arbitrary text with a host name. In addition, the Text Record is used to support record types such as those used in Sender Policy Framework (SPF) e-mail validation. Using the Text Record workflow, you can add, delete, or update Text Records in a zone. This workflow is ideal for self-service customers using the BlueCat Gateway user interface and for IPAM or DNS administrators to help reduce the repetition usually associated with daily record management.
