# **BlueCat Gateway Example Workflows**

# **Update: further restructure to the Examples folder**

Effective immediately,
the Certified folder is being Deprecated
and will be removed with the release of BlueCat Gateway 20.12.1 in December, 2020.
All of the BlueCat-supported content within the folder,
including Certified workflows and the Cisco ACI workflow
will be available as BlueCat Adaptive Plugins
distributed via our cloud registry within the next few releases of BlueCat Gateway.
Gateway Support is required to obtain support from BlueCat for these Adaptive Plugins.
The Examples folder will once again be used to house example Gateway workflows.
These example workflows demonstrate the power and flexibility of BlueCat Gateway
and contain some best practices when creating your own workflow.
These workflows are merely examples and are not meant to be directly used in production.
These example workflows are NOT supported by BlueCat.

## **Customer Impact**

Beginning in BlueCat Gateway v20.12.1,
the GitHub Import feature will no longer pull from Certified,
only from the Examples folder.
As previously mentioned, these example workflows are NOT supported by BlueCat.

Customers running Gateway 20.6.1 or earlier
will not be able to import Certified workflows
when performing GitHub Import,
or the import operation will exit with an error in the log files.
**BlueCat advises all customers on versions 20.6.1 and earlier
to upgrade to the latest BlueCat Gateway version
in order to maintain operation of the GitHub Import functionality.**
