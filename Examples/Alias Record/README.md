# **Example Alias Record Workflows**
## Add, Delete, and Update Alias Records

**BlueCat Gateway Version:** 20.6.1 or greater <br/>
**BAM version:** 9.1.0 and greater <br/>
**Dependencies:** Configuration, View, Zone, Block, Network, and Host Record previously created in Address Manager <br/>
**Description/Example Usage:** The Alias (CNAME) Record requires a name, linked record zone, and a linked Host Record. Using the Alias Record workflow, you can add, delete, or update Alias (CNAME) Records in a zone. This workflow is ideal for self-service customers using the BlueCat Gateway user interface and for IPAM or DNS administrators to help reduce the repetition usually associated with daily record management.
