Description: manage_records contains a suite of REST APIs to manage various types of resource records. There is also an option to manage them via bulk operations. The type of records supported are: A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, and TLSA
/manage_records/create_record
Submit JSON data to create a record. By default records are NOT deployed. Either the deploy_records API can be called, or you can pass in "deploy" as part of the request JSON data, and it will deploy the record immediately. "ping_check" can be added as a part of the request in the JSON request data to have the workflow conduct a ping check prior to assigning the record.
Please see the Postman Collection for examples of all the calls you can make

/manage_records/delete_record
Submit JSON data to delete a record. By default the deletion will be deployed. Pass in "deploy" as part of the JSON data to prevent the delete of the record

/manage_records/update_record
Submit JSON data to update a particular record. This updates the content(for example, the linked IP address to a host name) and not the name or zone of the record. To modify that you must delete and recreate. By default the changes will NOT be deployed. Either the deploy_records API can be called, or you can pass in "deploy" as part of the request JSON data, and it will deploy the record immediately. "ping_check" can be added as a part of the request in the JSON request data to have the workflow conduct a ping check prior to updating the record.

/manage_records/bulk_process
Submit a csv formatted file to do any of the above processes. Here is the format to submit for the type of record:
    Actions - C,U,D
    A - record_type,action,deploy,name,zone,ip
    AAAA - record_type,action,deploy,name,zone,ip
    CNAME - record_type,action,deploy,name,zone,linked_record
    TXT - record_type,action,deploy,name,zone,text
    MX - record_type,action,deploy,name,zone,linked_record
    TLSA - record_type,action,deploy,name,zone,data

/manage_records/deploy_records
Submit a list of IDs via JSON to deploy the records and anything associated with them. This is done using the selective deploy function

/manage_records/get_record
Submit data to retrieve the information of a record

In the folder is a file called "manage_records.postman.json". This file can be imported in Postman as a Collection. It contains example REST calls. It must be used in a Postman Environment with the "server" variable defined which points to a Gateway server.

Installation Directions: 1. Import Workflow into Gateway
                         2. Navigate to the workflow in Gateway in the "workflows" directory
                         3. Modify the manage_records_config.py file to have the correct default values
                         4. Restart Gateway
