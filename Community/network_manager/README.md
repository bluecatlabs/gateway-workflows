  Description: This workflow provides a simple example of tying a user to an IP block, and an example of using a naming convention validator with regex. 


Directions:
1. Create a block with the name of your user, your networks will be created in this space. You could modify the code to map to user group or other attributes.
2. Optionally modify rules.json with different regex. If you aren’t a regex wizard, regex101.com is helpful.
